# Spread and rest properties support in acorn 5

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acorn5-object-spread.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/acorn5-object-spread)

Since spread and rest properties are part of ECMAScript 2018, acorn now supports them out of the box. Just make sure that you use acorn >= 5.4.1 and set `ecmaVersion` >= 9. This plugin is deprecated.
